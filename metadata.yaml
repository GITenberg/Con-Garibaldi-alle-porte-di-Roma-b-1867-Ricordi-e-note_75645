summary: '"Con Garibaldi alle porte di Roma: (1867) Ricordi e note" by Anton Giulio
  Barrili is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work reflects
  on the events surrounding the campaign to liberate Rome during the 1867 Garibaldi
  expedition, capturing the spirit and sentiments of those involved in this pivotal
  chapter of Italian unification. The narrative primarily involves the perspective
  of the unnamed protagonist and his companions as they navigate the challenges of
  their mission.  The opening portion of the book introduces the authorâ€™s reminiscence
  of the desperate and yet ardent yearning to support Garibaldi''s efforts to liberate
  Rome from papal control. The narrator recounts the difficulty of leaving Genova
  amidst the scrutiny of authorities, outlining the concerns over government restrictions
  and the urgency felt by those wanting to join the struggle. As he prepares to embark
  on his journey, he reflects on his comrades and their bravery while vividly illustrating
  the landscapes, political tensions, and personal reflections that accompany their
  endeavor. The mix of adventure, personal struggle, and camaraderie sets the tone
  for a poignant exploration of historical heroism against the backdrop of a crucial
  moment in Italy''s path to unification. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
